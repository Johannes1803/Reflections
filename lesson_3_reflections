In unit 3 remote repositories are introduced. They allow to upload the repositories to GitHub.
But why is that an important feature? First of all it allows me to access the remote from different devices.
But more importantly I can share my work with certain collaborators or even an active programming community.
Why changes are pulled manually rather than automatically:
Your work may be in a stage where you don`t consider it ready for the public. Still you want to commit changes
to it.
